# simple-python-voice-assistant
A simple python voice assistant if you don't trust Alexa. (like me lol)
Built this because I don't trust Alexa. Currently it has very limited functionality, but in the future I plan to add things including music control, and better voice recognition. 
# Currently the only functionality it has is: 
Searches the wiki and gives you response
can open websites

# What I need to add:
responds to prompts if didn't understand
music controls
time functionality (currently can tell if its morning, evening or night but been distracted by other projects so haven't made it tell the exact time yet)
weather functionality


#t his readme will be updated as I work on the project.
