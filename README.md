# simple-python-voice-assistant
A simple python voice assistant if you don't trust Alexa. (like me lol) <br>
Built this because I don't trust commerical voice assistants. Currently it has very limited functionality, but in the future I plan to add things including music control, and better voice recognition. <br>
# Currently the only functionality it has is: 
Searches the wiki and gives you response <br>
can open websites <br>

# What I need to add:
responds to prompts if didn't understand <br>
music controls <br>
time functionality (currently can tell if its morning, evening or night but been distracted by other projects so haven't made it tell the exact time yet) <br>
weather functionality <br>


this readme will be updated as I work on the project.
